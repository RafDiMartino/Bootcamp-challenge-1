# Code Refactor - challenge

## Description
In this assignement my task was to refactor the HTML code to meet modern "Accessibility" standards.
I have achieved the above by:
- Adding all the suitables semantic HTML elements, 
- Using "alt" attribute for images and icons,
- Making sure that all heading elements fall in sequential order
- Adding a concise and descriptive title
- I have also refactored the CSS by grouping and simplyfing the selectors following the DRY principle
